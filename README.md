# Facial-Emotion-Recognition

Over 35,000 photographs collected in the data in 2013, some of the existing photographs were taken from various media publications and some of them consist of stock photographs. Our goal here is to recognize 7 different emotions (angry, happy, scared, natural, etc.) through photographs with a convolutional neural network.
